# TLAC(Think Like A Computer) 

TLAC is a boardgame I am developing to teach programming
let me give you an example of a level in the game

initial state of the board:
![Initial state of board](https://github.com/amigojapan/ThinkLikeAComputer/blob/main/program7-start-state.jpg "Initial state of board")

if you follow [this program](https://amjp.psy-k.org/TLAC/problem7-programchartEN.html) in your mind:  

you end up with this board:
![Final state of board](https://github.com/amigojapan/ThinkLikeAComputer/blob/main/program7-end-state.jpg "Final state of board")

# How to play:

to complete the level you need to run this program in your mind, and the pattern needs to match the final state of the board, if it does, you win, if it does not, you lose

notes:

Function call Turtle Move Foward parameters: H
H is the heigh of the board

if you preffer look at [the original program](https://github.com/amigojapan/ThinkLikeAComputer/blob/main/problem7-program.py)


this is [the output of python program](https://github.com/amigojapan/ThinkLikeAComputer/blob/main/problem7-output.txt)



# TLAC instruction manual:
I am planning on starting with all the programs in pseudocode HTML, and then moving the players into using a text version of the pseudo code, and finally moving the users to using python

# FAQ:
Do you have a class youre teaching?
-I used to teach programming to kids, but no, I am just doing this, my job is allowing me to develop the boardgame during work time

Why a board game and not a viddeogame?
-I think this can be used in like countries where computers are not easy to access,just by owning the board game

How many players do you need to play TLAC?
-this is a single player board game

# TODO
-make the documentation for TLAC, a kind of tutorial or manual (I particularly need help with this) [here](https://amjp.psy-k.org/TLAC/8_basics_of_programming_TLAC.html) is a sample of what I have written up to now

-make a tool to convert the generated outputof programs into board states in graphics in HTML
